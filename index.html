                <p>In all announcements, news headlines, or email subject lines, we can discern an element of
                    <span class="ital">time</span>. The root of many-an-adage, we cannot escape time. Instead, we are
                    constantly working to carve out our place within it. It can be assumed that something deserved of a
                    banner denotes that a certain amount of time has passed and has brought with it change: a birth, a
                    death, a graduation, a president. Though not always positive or welcome, it marks something forever
                    evolved. Of course, there is no rigid contrast between change and time but they both exist in a
                    dichotomy between <span class="ital">light</span> and <span class="ital">dark</span>; where light
                    shines on innovation and progress, and dark shelters tradition and simplicity. We move in the light
                    of our quotidian though we may praise the steadfastness of shadows. Fortunately, we are never
                    navigating totally blind.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">Praise requires a certain amount of rebuke. We hold onto fond associations of a
                    memory, a person, a place, only because we know that they could otherwise be lost in the lights that
                    are constantly shining. This praise allows us to discover beauty in that which remains still, and,
                    if we’re lucky, we find moments of reflection to think about what it is we really want.</p>
                <p class="indent">Of course, our desires may vary but if we’re lucky they can be immortalized into
                    something we hold on to forever. This exhibition brings together artists of today, not tomorrow; A
                    collective of painters and printmakers who have found a way to hang on to a shadow. Their work
                    explores ways to remember a portrait, ways to embrace the past using technologies of the future,
                    they have collected sounds and objects from parts of the world less-visited and brought them to the
                    fore. Grouped together, this exhibition creates a space where seriality and revision are embraced
                    and where contemplation is long and encouraged.</p>
                <p class="indent">Shadows, paradoxically, cast light on things almost forgotten. And how rich in the
                    shadows is the place of time and memory.</p> <br>
